##Installation Notes

###_Step 1_: Install Dependencies

Use `npm i` to install all the needed dependencies.

###_Step 2_: Add Environment Variables

Add a `.env` file on the same level as the `example.env` file and declare the variables properly by referring the example file.

###_Step 3_: Start the Server

TypeScript does not compile by itself. But this project has the proper scripts set up. Use `npm run dev` to compile the TS files into a build folder and start the development server.
